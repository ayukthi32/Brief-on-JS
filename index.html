    <h2>Berlin</h2>
    <p>
      Berlin, Germanyâ€™s capital, dates to the 13th century. Reminders of the city's turbulent 20th-century history
      include its Holocaust memorial and the Berlin Wall's graffitied remains. Divided during the Cold War, its
      18th-century Brandenburg Gate has become a symbol of reunification. The city's also known for its art scene and
      modern landmarks like the gold-colored, swoop-roofed Berliner Philharmonie, built in 1963.

    The Reichstag is a historic government building in Berlin which houses the Bundestag, the lower house of Germany's
    parliament. The Reichstag was constructed to house the Imperial Diet of the German Empire. It was opened in 1894 and
    housed the Diet until 1933, when it was set on fire. In World War II, during the Battle of Berlin, the building was
    severely damaged by the Soviet Red Army. After the war, the building fell into disuse; the parliament of the German
    Democratic Republic met in the Palast der Republik in East Berlin, while the parliament of the Federal Republic of
    Germany met in the Bundeshaus in Bonn. Theruined building was made safe against the elements and partially
    refurbished
    in the 1960s, but no attempt at full
    restoration was made until after German reunification in 1990, when it underwent a reconstruction led by architect
    Norman Foster. After its completion in 1999, it once again became the meeting place of the German parliament: the
    contemporary Bundestag
